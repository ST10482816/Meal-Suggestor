## Purpose
This is an android app that will allow the user to get a quick idea for a meal to have depending on the time of day they choose to enter into the app.

## Features
Features of this app include:
  - Displaying a meal suggestion based on time of day.
  - Displaying error messages on incorrect inputs from the user via a Toast.

## Design Considerations
I designed this app with the intention of having an easy-going feel to it, suitable for a meal suggestion application.
